This is a basic implementation of making a chatbot using an open source API of gemini-pro.
This is a streamlit based local app where we can ask any queries to the bot and it will respond accordingly.
This will ensure that a user gets his desired ouput with less effort.
The bot generates the answer to the queries in chunks.
Also another advantage is that we can view the chat history using streamlit's method of session_state.
This is a chatbot which has convenient session_state with which we can view the chat history.
